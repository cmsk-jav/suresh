description: Pro-Timer records the time that you've spent on a project and aggregates them based on the date. So that you should be able to know how much time a project should need to get done. And this also makes you work even faster because if you're going to a competition or a hackathon Then all of them expect you to solve a problem or a task within the specified timeframe. By practicing this, You can achieve it quickly!!
kudos: And kudos to all the Open-Source developers :-)
